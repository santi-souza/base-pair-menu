# Bioinformatics Coordinate System Menu

This repository contains a Python program developed as part of a mandatory project for the Biotechnology Engineering degree at Universidad ORT. 
The program implements a menu-driven system that allows users to perform various operations related to nucleotide base sequences and coordinate systems in a bioinformatics context. 
The project showcases fundamental programming skills, including function creation, error handling, and user interaction.

## Features

The program offers the following functionalities:

1. **Parse Bases**: Convert nucleotide bases into numerical coordinates.
2. **Transpose a Point**: Swap the coordinates of a point.
3. **Calculate the Average of Two Points**: Compute the midpoint between two coordinate pairs.
4. **Calculate Distance Between Two Points**: Determine the Euclidean distance between two points in a coordinate plane.
5. **Apply Deviation Based on Sequence**: Adjust a coordinate point based on the CG content of a given nucleotide sequence.
6. **Sort and Print Numbers**: Sort and display the coordinates of two points.
7. **Parse Inexact Codon**: Generate a codon from the maximum values of given points.
8. **Parse Exact Codon**: Generate a codon by mapping coordinate sums to base pairs.

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the `menu.py` file. The program will display a menu that allows you to select various operations. You can interact with the menu by entering the number corresponding to the desired action.
